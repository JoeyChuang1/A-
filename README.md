Implemented an A pathfinding algorithm in Python to efficiently navigate between any two points on a grid-based map. The algorithm leverages heuristic functions to prioritize promising paths, leading to faster route discovery. A video demonstration showcases the functionality.

Furthermore, I optimized the performance of the algorithm by an average of 71%. This improvement was achieved through a combination of techniques:

Multiprocessing: By distributing computations across multiple cores, the algorithm can explore a larger search space concurrently, accelerating pathfinding.

heurispy library integration: This library provides pre-defined heuristic functions optimized for various pathfinding scenarios, ensuring efficient exploration strategies.

Pygame visualization: While Pygame is primarily used for game development, it can also be leveraged for efficient visualization of the pathfinding process, aiding in debugging and understanding.
